# Student Management System in C

A simple **Student Management System** written in C that stores data in a binary file (`students.dat`) and uses a **Menu-Driven CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approach** as the main program logic.  
The program continuously displays a menu, takes the user’s choice, and performs the corresponding operation until the user chooses to exit.

## Main Program Logic: Menu-Driven CRUD Operations

The system revolves around **CRUD**:

- **C — Create:** Add new student records.  
- **R — Read:** Display all records or search for a specific record.  
- **U — Update:** Modify existing student records.  
- **D — Delete:** Remove student records from the file.

**Menu Flow:**
The menu repeats after each operation until Exit is selected.
- Input is validated before processing.
